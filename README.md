- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrea Puzo, currently a failed physics student
- 👀 I’m interested in many subjects, from natural to human sciences, technologies and arts
- 🌱 I’m currently learning...
  - how does radiation (particles at relativity velocities) interact with matter
  - how can I use SiPM and amplifiers to catch photons studying interesting events
  - how can I simulate those events using GEANT4, ROOT, and C++
  - how do computers work under the hood, I am obsessed by protocols
  - how do programming and human languages work, and evolve through the human generations
  - how can I become a better human being
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source (maybe educational) projects
- 📫 How to reach me: andreapz3010@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact:
  - I’m either extremely sad or extremely funny but the middle ground is not for me
  - To every question like 'what did you do today?' I answer 'nothing'
  - I always carry earphones except when I travel by train... I'm too nosy, forgive me ;)
